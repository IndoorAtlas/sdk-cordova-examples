# IndoorAtlas Cordova and React.Native Plugin Examples

[IndoorAtlas](https://www.indooratlas.com/) provides a unique Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that runs a disruptive geomagnetic positioning in its full-stack hybrid technology for accurately pinpointing a location inside a building. The IndoorAtlas SDK enables app developers to use high-accuracy indoor positioning in venues that have been fingerprinted.

This repository provides examples for IndoorAtlas Cordova and React.Native Plugin.

Getting started requires you to set up a free developer account and fingerprint your indoor venue using the [IndoorAtlas MapCreator 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.indooratlas.android.apps.jaywalker).
See [IndoorAtlas developer documentation](https://docs.indooratlas.com)
for futher instructions. The full API documentation for the Cordova and React.Native plugin
is available at https://docs.indooratlas.com/cordova/latest/
